After long loops procastinating to avoid start writing something in my personal blog, today I decided to start with the idea I have from the beggining for my website: something useful.

So, the main scope will be to find stuff I use in everyday work. Probably lots of snippets but also thoughts and ideas. A way to execute searchs on things already done faster and hopefully better that googling over the time.
